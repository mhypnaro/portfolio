		- Run as "./myclient (ip) (port)"
			- () indicate mandatory argument, [] indicate optional argument
			- EX: ./myclient 11.11.11.11 8000

		- Run from the "bin" directory.
		- end the program with "exit".
	- myserver.cpp The source code for the server
		- Compile by running "make" while in the "src" directory.
		- Can also be compiled by running "make server" while in the "src" directory.

			- () indicate mandatory argument, [] indicate optional argument
			- EX: ./myserver 8000
